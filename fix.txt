# Hardcoded Paths Found in the Codebase

## 1. Background Image in `styles.css`
File: `src/styles.css`
Issue:
background-image: url('/src/assets/bg-pattern.png');
Recommendation:
Update to use a relative path or dynamic import.

---

## 2. Hat Image in `Canvas.tsx`
File: `src/components/Canvas.tsx`
Issue:
hatImg.src = hat; // props.hat is the imported asset URL
Recommendation:
Ensure `hat` resolves correctly during deployment.

---

## 3. Hat Image in `App.tsx`
File: `src/App.tsx`
Issue:
import scumbagHat from './assets/scumbag-hat.png';
Recommendation:
Ensure the asset is correctly placed in the `dist` folder during the build process.

## 4. Favicon in `index.html`
File: `index.html`
Issue:
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png" />
Recommendation:
Ensure the favicon is correctly placed in the `dist` folder.

## 5. Copy Icon in `index.html`
File: `index.html`

Update to use a relative path or ensure the file is correctly placed in the `dist` folder.

---

## 6. Script Path in `index.html`
File: `index.html`
Issue:
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
Recommendation:
Update to point to the built JavaScript file in the `dist` folder.

---

# Recommendations:
1. Use relative paths or dynamic imports for all hardcoded paths.
2. Verify asset placement in the `dist` folder during the build process.
3. Rebuild the project (`npm run build`) and redeploy (`npx gh-pages -d dist`).
4. Test the live site to ensure assets load correctly.
