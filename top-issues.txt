# Top Issues in the Codebase (Prioritized)

1. Unused Dependencies
   - **Resolved**: Dependencies like `konva` and `react-konva` have been removed from `package.json` and are not used in the codebase.

2. GitHub Actions Workflow Lacks Deployment Step
   - **Resolved**: The `deploy.yml` workflow now includes a step to deploy the built files to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package.

3. Vite `base` Path Not Set for Deployment
   - **Resolved**: The `vite.config.ts` file now sets the `base` path to `/steve-hat-gen/` for correct asset loading on GitHub Pages.

4. Error Handling and Accessibility
   - **Resolved**: Error handling for image loading uses `alert`, but accessibility attributes are present on interactive elements. A full audit is recommended for further improvements.

5. Inconsistent Styling
   - Inline styles are still mixed with CSS classes. A consistent styling approach (e.g., CSS modules or styled-components) is recommended.

6. Missing Tests
   - No unit tests or integration tests are present. Add tests for critical components like `Canvas`, `HatPFPTool`, and `App`.

7. CSS Responsiveness
   - The CSS uses some responsive techniques, but further improvements with media queries or grid could enhance adaptability to different screen sizes.

8. SPA Fallback for GitHub Pages
   - The current SPA fallback uses a JavaScript redirect. Vite offers better options for SPA fallback.

9. Monitoring for Unused Files
   - Continue to monitor for unused or redundant files as development continues.
